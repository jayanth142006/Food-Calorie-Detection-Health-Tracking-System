🍽️ Ever wondered what’s really on your plate — just by looking at it through AR/VR?

Introducing Food Nutrients Lens — an immersive AR/VR-powered food analysis experience that uses advanced AI to detect, segment, and break down the nutritional value of your meals in real time. 🥦🍗🍛

🔍 How it works:
▶️ Users upload a plate image using AR/VR interfaces (like Meta Quest).

▶️ Foods on the plate are detected using a custom-trained YOLOv11 model.

▶️ Each food item is segmented using SAM2 (Segment Anything Model).

▶️ Segmented images are passed to the Gemini API, which returns precise calorie and macro-nutrient breakdowns.

▶️ With beautiful animations (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), each food item floats apart on screen — visually displaying insights in a clear, animated table format.

🎯 Key Highlights:
✅ Seamless AR/VR integration
✅ Real-time food detection and segmentation
✅ Gemini-powered nutritional analysis
✅ Visually engaging breakdown with smooth UI animations

🔧 Tech Stack: YOLOv11, SAM2, Gemini API, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AR/VR (Meta)
